# Cryptographic Design

This is a reader's summary. The **authoritative, testable** specification is
[vault_intent.yaml](../vault_intent.yaml) (constraints C1–C6, C9–C10, C25); the research rationale
is in [research/vault_spec.md](../research/vault_spec.md).

## Primitives (audited libraries only — constraint C3)

| Purpose | Primitive | Crate |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Payload AEAD | XChaCha20-Poly1305, STREAM (64 KiB chunks) | `chacha20poly1305` |
| Password KDF | Argon2id (m=64 MiB, t=3, p=4 default) | `argon2` |
| Key wrapping / derivation | HKDF-SHA-256 | `hkdf` |
| Header & block integrity | HMAC-SHA-256 | `hmac`, `sha2` |
| Constant-time comparison | `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` | `subtle` |
| Randomness | OS CSPRNG | `getrandom` |

**No custom cryptography. Ever.** (C3) If a primitive isn't in an audited library, we don't ship it.

## Key hierarchy

```
master password ──Argon2id(salt, m,t,p)──▶ master_key
                                             │
                 HKDF(info="vault-pw-wrap")  ▼
                                          wrapping_key ──unwrap──▶ data_key (256-bit, random)
                                                                     │
                          HKDF(salt=nonce_prefix, info="vault-payload-v1")   ▼
                                                              payload_key ──STREAM──▶ entries
```

- The **data key** is random per vault (CSPRNG), never derived from the password, never stored in
  plaintext (C4). Changing the password re-wraps one stanza; the payload is untouched.
- **Any-of-N stanzas**: password (always present) + optional FIDO2 / YubiKey / TPM / Secure Enclave /
  DPAPI. Any single valid stanza unlocks (C5). Lose a hardware factor → password still works.

## Why these choices (the short version)

- **XChaCha20 over AES-GCM**: 192-bit nonce → safe random nonces at scale; no catastrophic
  nonce-reuse cliff. STREAM chunks are location-bound (no reorder/truncate/splice).
- **Argon2id over Argon2d/PBKDF2**: memory-hard *and* side-channel-resistant (the KeePassXC auditor's
  explicit recommendation). The **floor is enforced on every open** so a downgraded file is caught;
  a **ceiling** (coverage-gap A1) rejects hostile/overflowing params *before* allocation.
- **KDBX-4-style integrity**: unauthenticated `SHA-256(header)` for fast corruption detection, plus
  master-key-**keyed** `HMAC-SHA-256(header)` so an attacker can't downgrade the KDF undetected.

## What we deliberately do *not* do

- No deterministic per-entry encryption (leakage-abuse attacks — Grubbs et al.).
- No server-supplied or compiled-in KDF params — the **file** is authoritative (C8).
- No `memset`/`memzero` for zeroization — `zeroize`'s volatile write + fence only (C11).
- No network calls, telemetry, or update checks (C23).

## Post-quantum posture

The symmetric core (XChaCha20, Argon2id, HMAC/HKDF-SHA-256) retains ~128-bit security under Grover —
fine. Optional asymmetric stanzas (FIDO2 P-256, Secure Enclave secp256r1) wrap a symmetric data key
and are never the sole path. The versioned format (C7) reserves room for a future hybrid-PQ wrap.
