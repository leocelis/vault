# Technical Design Specs

One spec per major use case in the [PRD](../PRD.md). Each spec proposes a concrete design
grounded in prior art (open-source projects and academic/standards sources), maps it to the
binding constraints in [`vault_intent.yaml`](../../vault_intent.yaml), and ends with a test
plan and open questions.

**Precedence:** where a spec and the intent artifact disagree, the intent wins. Specs are
*how we plan to satisfy* the constraints; the intent is *what must be true*.

## Spec lifecycle

`Draft` → reviewed by maintainers → `Accepted` (hard-to-reverse decisions also get an
[ADR](../adr/)) → implementation per the intent's segmentation plan → spec updated to
`Implemented` with deviations noted. New constraints discovered while spec-writing are
proposed as Part-2 candidates — C35+; the 2026-06-10 pass promoted the first batch as C28–C34 (see
[research/security_coverage_gaps.md](../../research/security_coverage_gaps.md)).
