# Verifying Releases

A security tool you can't verify is a security tool you have to *trust*. Vault releases are
**reproducible**, **keylessly signed with Sigstore cosign**, and accompanied by **SLSA build
provenance** and SHA-256 checksums. Here's how to check what you downloaded. *(constraint C34)*

> Applies to tagged releases once the build/release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs.
> Pre-alpha has no releases yet.

## 1. Verify the checksum

```sh
# Download the binary and its SHA256SUMS file from the GitHub Release, then:
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.txt
```

## 2. Verify the cosign signature (keyless / Sigstore)

Each artifact ships with a `.sig` signature and a `.pem` certificate. Cosign verifies the artifact
was signed by Vault's GitHub Actions release workflow via its OIDC identity:

```sh
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate vault-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.pem \
  --signature   vault-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/leocelis/vault/.github/workflows/release.yml@.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
  vault-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

A `Verified OK` result means the binary was produced by *our* release workflow, not substituted.

## 3. Verify SLSA provenance

The release includes a `provenance` attestation (`*.intoto.jsonl`). Verify it with `slsa-verifier`:

```sh
slsa-verifier verify-artifact vault-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl \
  --provenance-path provenance.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/leocelis/vault
```

## 4. (Optional) Reproduce the build yourself

Because the toolchain is pinned (`rust-toolchain.toml`) and we build `--locked`, you can rebuild
bit-for-bit and compare:

```sh
git checkout vX.Y.Z
cargo build --release --locked --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
shasum -a 256 target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/vault
# Compare against the published checksum.
```

If any step fails, **do not run the binary** — open a security report (see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)).
