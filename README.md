# 🔐 Vault

**Security for the AI era — a zero-plaintext, local-first vault for the secrets developers actually have.**

Passwords. API keys. `.env` files. SSH and signing keys. Database URLs. The credentials your AI tools can see.

> Vault is **functional**: cryptographic core implemented and tested, working CLI *and* desktop app.
> **On-disk format v1 is stable** ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-format-v1-freeze.md)) — vault files from
> alpha releases open on 1.x without migration. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Why Vault exists

Developers now work alongside AI agents that can read their files, run their shells, and touch
their credentials. The threat model changed — the tools didn't. Vault is built for the people
who feel that gap:

- **Current managers fall short on the AI-era threat model.** LastPass shipped plaintext URLs
  and 1-iteration KDFs; `pass` leaks every entry name through filenames and git history;
  KeePassXC defaulted to Argon2d and doesn't encrypt secrets in memory. And in 2025 we saw the
  first AI-*orchestrated* credential-harvesting campaigns and malware that calls an LLM at
  runtime. (See [research/llm_offensive_threats.md](research/llm_offensive_threats.md).)
- **Current managers are too complex to *understand*.** If you can't tell *how* a tool protects
  you, you can't trust it. Vault's entire design is written down as **falsifiable constraints**
  you can read in an afternoon — every security claim has a test.

Vault's bet: be **verifiably more secure than anything free** *and* **simple enough that a
developer who is nervous about AI exposure can actually adopt it.**

## What makes it different

| | Vault | Typical free manager |
|---|---|---|
| Plaintext metadata (URLs, titles, timestamps) | **None — all encrypted** | Often leaks at least some |
| KDF | **Argon2id, floor enforced on open** | Argon2d / PBKDF2; no floor check |
| Unlock model | **Multi-stanza unlock** — password always works; optional **YubiKey or keyfile 2FA** on CLI/GUI ([hardware status](docs/guides/hardware-factor-status.md); FIDO2/TPM/SE deferred) | Single factor |
| In-memory secrets | **`zeroize` + `mlock`** | Often left in plaintext |
| Whole-file rollback by a sync backend | **Detected** (monotonic counter) | Undetected |
| AI-era hardening | **CSPRNG generation + model-blind delivery** | Not designed for it |
| How you verify the claims | **60 constraints** with distributed tests ([index](docs/CONSTRAINT_INDEX.md)) | Trust us |

## Install

**Fastest path** — download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/leocelis/vault/releases), verify SHA256SUMS, `chmod +x`, move to PATH.

Prebuilt binaries today: **macOS x86_64 only** (`v1.0.0`). Linux, Windows, and Apple Silicon: build from source ([docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)).

```sh
# Example (macOS x86_64) — see docs/VERIFYING_RELEASES.md
curl -LO https://github.com/leocelis/vault/releases/download/v1.0.0/vault-x86_64-apple-darwin
curl -LO https://github.com/leocelis/vault/releases/download/v1.0.0/SHA256SUMS.txt
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
chmod +x vault-x86_64-apple-darwin && sudo mv vault-x86_64-apple-darwin /usr/local/bin/vault
```

**Build from source** (contributors):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leocelis/vault.git && cd vault
./scripts/setup-rust.sh && ./scripts/install.sh   # → ~/.local/bin/vault
```

Or `cargo install --git https://github.com/leocelis/vault.git --tag v1.0.0 --locked vault-cli`

Full options: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)

## Quickstart

```sh
vault init
vault import --format raw --yes samples/keys.txt   # synthetic sample — safe to try
vault ls
vault get github                                   # copies to clipboard (model-blind)
vault gen --length 24
vault add myservice                                # interactive — no secrets on argv
```

Desktop app: `cargo run -p vault-gui` — drag `samples/keys.txt` onto the window to import.
