# 🔐 Vault

**Security for the AI era — a zero-plaintext, local-first vault for the secrets developers actually have.**

Passwords. API keys. `.env` files. SSH and signing keys. Database URLs. The credentials your AI tools can see.

## Why Vault exists

Developers now work alongside AI agents that can read their files, run their shells, and touch
their credentials. The threat model changed — the tools didn't. Vault is built for the people
who feel that gap:

- **Current managers fall short on the AI-era threat model.** LastPass shipped plaintext URLs
  and 1-iteration KDFs; `pass` leaks every entry name through filenames and git history;
  KeePassXC defaulted to Argon2d and doesn't encrypt secrets in memory. And in 2025 we saw the
  first AI-*orchestrated* credential-harvesting campaigns and malware that calls an LLM at
  runtime. (See [research/llm_offensive_threats.md](research/llm_offensive_threats.md).)
- **Current managers are too complex to *understand*.** If you can't tell *how* a tool protects
  you, you can't trust it. Vault's entire design is written down as **falsifiable constraints**
  you can read in an afternoon — every security claim has a test.

Vault's bet: be **verifiably more secure than anything free** *and* **simple enough that a
developer who is nervous about AI exposure can actually adopt it.**

## What makes it different

| | Vault | Typical free manager |
|---|---|---|
| Plaintext metadata (URLs, titles, timestamps) | **None — all encrypted** | Often leaks at least some |
| KDF | **Argon2id, floor enforced on open** | Argon2d / PBKDF2; no floor check |
| Unlock model | **Any-of-N stanzas** (password + hardware + OS keystore) | Single factor |
| In-memory secrets | **`zeroize` + `mlock`** | Often left in plaintext |
| Whole-file rollback by a sync backend | **Detected** (monotonic counter) | Undetected |
| AI-era hardening | **CSPRNG generation + model-blind delivery** | Not designed for it |
| How you verify the claims | **60 constraints** with distributed tests ([index](docs/CONSTRAINT_INDEX.md)) | Trust us |

## Design at a glance

- **Cipher:** XChaCha20-Poly1305 in STREAM mode (64 KiB chunks, tag-verified before release).
- **KDF:** Argon2id (default m=64 MiB, t=3, p=4), with an enforced minimum floor *and* a maximum
  ceiling against hostile files.
- **Envelope:** age-style multi-stanza — a random per-vault data key wrapped by any of: password
  (always present), FIDO2/PRF, YubiKey, TPM, macOS Secure Enclave, Windows DPAPI. Lose a hardware
  factor, keep your vault.
- **Format:** versioned, KDBX-4-style header integrity (SHA-256 + keyed HMAC), encrypt-then-MAC body.
- **Everything encrypted:** one opaque blob, safe to sync over Git / Syncthing / Dropbox.
- **Zero network. Zero telemetry. Ever.**

## Quickstart

```sh
# Build from source or `cargo install vault-cli --locked`; produces one static binary, no runtime deps.
cargo build --release -p vault-cli
alias vault=target/release/vault

vault init                      # create a vault (prompts for a master password)
vault import --format raw --yes keys.txt   # migrate a messy keys.txt (use --yes when piped)
vault gen --length 24           # generate a CSPRNG password…
vault gen --words 8             # …or a diceware passphrase
vault add github                # add an entry (no secrets on the command line)
vault get github                # copy password to clipboard (auto-clears in 30s)
vault otp github                # copy the current 2FA code (if the entry has a 2FA secret)
vault ls --search git           # search after unlock (in-memory only)
vault tune                      # benchmark Argon2id and recommend KDF params
vault pad on                    # hide the file's exact size on untrusted storage (Padmé)
```

### Desktop app *(works today, locally)*

There is a simple, fast, pure-Rust **desktop window app** (`vault-gui`) over the same core — create
or unlock a vault, **drag a `keys.txt` onto the window** (or pick one) to import with a masked
review, **type to search**, and **copy** a password that stays **shadowed** on screen (the secret is
never rendered; the clipboard auto-clears). You can add, edit, change, and delete entries.

```sh
cargo run -p vault-gui          # launch the window
./scripts/bundle-macos.sh       # macOS: build a double-clickable target/Vault.app
```

It shares one vault with the CLI/TUI at `~/.vault/vault.vlt`, auto-locks when idle, and shows live
2FA codes. (Functional but not yet independently audited — see the warning above.)

Secrets are **never** passed as command-line arguments, and `vault get` delivers to the clipboard
by default so an AI agent watching stdout can't scrape them. To be precise about the boundary:
this defends against *incidental* capture (a secret landing in an agent's transcript); a hostile
agent with shell access to an unlocked session is same-user malware, bounded — not eliminated — by
auto-lock and clipboard concealment. See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) and the
[threat model](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md).

## Project status

Vault follows **Intent-Verified Development**: the design is captured as testable constraints
*before* code. We are here:

- ✅ Research foundation — [research/](research/)
- ✅ Intent specification — [vault_intent.yaml](vault_intent.yaml) (60 constraints, 15 groups, v1.7.0)
- ✅ Open-source scaffolding — this repository
- ✅ **Core implementation** — encrypted format, Argon2id, in-memory protection, rollback
  detection, CLI **and** desktop app (CI green on Linux/macOS/Windows; see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md))
- ⏳ Remaining features — hardware-backed unlock polish, sync/merge (see the roadmap)
- ⏳ **1.0 release** — format freeze + broader constraint test coverage
